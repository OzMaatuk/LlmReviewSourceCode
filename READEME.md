# LLM Review Source Code.

This notebook implements simple way to use LLM (using Langchain and OpenAI) to manipulate source code.

The example works with cpp source code and adds documentation to each file.

This can be used also for fixing, extending or reviwing source code.

The program gathers all source files and creating a retriver to be used by the llm.
